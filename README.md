**Enterprise Project Management System**

A production-grade Project Management System built with Django & PostgreSQL, designed to handle real-world organizational hierarchies, multi-project role management, and dynamic team structures.

This project demonstrates backend architecture design, role-based access control, scalable data modeling, and external API integration.


**About the Project**

This project was built as a portfolio-grade application to demonstrate real-world backend engineering skills, not just CRUD functionality.

If you're a recruiter or developer reviewing this repo, feel free to explore the codebase — the architecture is the real highlight.


**Why This Project?**

Most project management apps stop at basic roles.
This system goes further by implementing:

✅ Multi-level organizational hierarchy

✅ Project-specific roles (JSON-based)

✅ Dynamic team roles

✅ External API role normalization

✅ Enterprise-grade access control

Built to reflect how actual companies operate.
